How to use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

This module defines a function used to divide each elements of a matrix ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

```matrix_divided(matrix, div)``` returns a new matrix with each of the elements divided by div.

::

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

When a list containing a list (matrix) of integers is passed each element is divided by the
divisor and returned in a new matrix of integers is returned


>>> matrix_divided( [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]], 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]


Exceptions
==========

If the passed matrix is not of type list a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix_divided("a", 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> matrix_divided(1, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

If the passed matrix is a list but the elements of the matrix are not lists
a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix_divided(["a", "b"], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> matrix_divided([1,23], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

If the passed matrix contains a list of a list but the inner list does not contain
ints or floats a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix_divided([["a", "b"], ["e","f"]], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

If each row of the matrix is not of the same size a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix_divided([[1,2,2],[3,4]], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

If the divisor is not an int or a float a TypeError is raised

>>> matrix_divided([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]], "a")
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: div must be a number

If the divisor is less than 0 a ZeroDivisionError is raised

>>> matrix_divided([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
